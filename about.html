                The Backrooms is conseptual idea formed by a 4chan user after they posted a photo of the inside to a cleared out building that used to be a hobby shop in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. 
            The Idea behind the backrooms however is a fictional concept in which a person "No-Clips" through reality or passes through solid ground and is transported to a never ending landscape
            of an abandoned office building. Through here however lies an almost endless adventure to get out. To do this one must try to find areas to yet again pass through or "No-Clip" through walls to transport to different levels on random.
            There is however food to survive, but extremely dangerous and gross monsters or "entities" as they are called by the community.
